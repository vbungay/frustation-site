                I spent more and more time in my tiny apartment, surrounded by dusty books and unfinished projects.
                I questioned my abilities and wondered if I had made a mistake choosing this path. The vibrant city that
                once inspired me now felt suffocating, and I began to lose sight of his dreams.
